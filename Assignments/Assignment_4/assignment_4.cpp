/*
Question 1:
Pointers allow the creation and manipulation of 
arrays whose sizes are determined at runtime.
This is because a pointer can reference memory 
allocated dynamically, and pointer arithmetic 
lets us access array elements regardless of the 
arrayâ€™s size.

Question 2:
Vectors are more efficient and flexible than 
standard arrays because they can automatically 
resize during runtime.
They allocate space as needed, so the program 
always has the right amount of memory for its 
data, avoiding wasted space or overflow errors.
